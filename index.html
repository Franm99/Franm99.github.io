                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    I'm a junior software developer with a strong interest in learning new things every day.
                    I enjoy challenging myself to improve my knowledge in different software development fields, 
                    such as Machine Learning, Data Science and Web development. <br><br>

                    During my studies of Electronic Engineering, Robotics and Mechatronics at the University of 
                    Malaga(Spain), I gained technical knowledge about the functioning of automatic and industrial 
                    systems, both on the hardware and software side, and manipulation and autonomous robotics 
                    techniques. Here I realized for the first time how fascinating and challenging the world of 
                    software development can be, especially when it is applied to improve people's lives. <br><br>

                    Due to the curiosity that began to grow inside me about this field, I applied for studying a 
                    Master’s degree in Intelligent Systems at Universitat Jaume I, in Castellón (Spain). Personally, 
                    I see the year this studies occupied (2021) as the most valuable for my student career. Here, 
                    I keep learning about robotics, and how artificial intelligence can be applied to them for social 
                    service purposes. Machine learning was the software field in which I spent most of my time, 
                    particularly in my Master’s Thesis. <br><br>

                    At this time, I’m working on a research project for an AI-based solution applied to medical image 
                    analysis. Although my career has started focusing on Machine Learning development, I’m very 
                    open-minded and try to learn from fields that are not really related. One of them is Web development.
                     That’s why I felt the necessity to build up my own portfolio as a personal project.
